# 5 Reason You Should Use Paid VPN(Must avoid Free-VPN)
There are a lot of Free-VPN services. do you ever think about Profit structure of Free VPN company?
It takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to run vpn server. where the big money come from.

The answer is.. 'from you'..  
You Must know The fact that VPN companies sell your personal information and VPN usage data.

**This is How They Get Money From You.**

* they say "hey! free VPN service is here!! download it!"
* Collect your data through malware or tracking code(its hidden in VPN's program) and firefox, chrome extension vpn had discovered Browser hijacking
* Worst is steal your bandwidth(Hola VPN and some of free vpn companies did it!)
* and Sell the data. usually advertiser companies buy data.

**So why do I want you to use Paid VPN?**

* **They don't touch and store your data**(of cource there are some bad paid vpn. I'll exclude them from my recommand list.)
* Features for Security(DNS leak, Kill switch, IP address leaks 'IPv4 and IPv6', WebRTC leaks etc..) this is very important to protect your infomation.
* Great Support(email and live chat)
* Real unlimited traffic(Some VPN prividers have limit of vpn speed)
* no one can find your real information(IP address, connection infomation etc..) even FBI, CIA can't track you.



## The safest privacy policy
all most VPN providers say "we don't store or record your information"
but it is not true.
PureVPN helped FBI to catch bad guy(purevpn provided information to fbi.).
and Hotspot Shield accused selling users data

Free-VPNs are always sell your information to provide VPN service for you.(it's ironic)

Most secure VPNs are Express VPN and Nord VPN
Because of their headquarters location.

Express VPN based in the BVI(British Virgin Islands). It is located next to Puertrico(near Cuba).
BVI has its own legislature. It is legal not to store user's vpn records(not in USA or EU countries also not part of 14 Eyes intelligence)

There are no data retention laws in the BVI. foreign government want user's infomation they have to make request to BVI High Court and prove it is serious crime. but it is too big task to catch one person(unless you are as big target as terrorist boss)
even if foreign government got permission from BVI High Court
but there is no data which can prove what you did.

Nord VPN is based in panama. I think Not as good as bvi, but it is safe enough.
